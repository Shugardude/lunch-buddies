# Lunch Buddies
> It's tough meeting new people at work.  Now there's an app for it.

With Lunch Buddies, you can add new employee names to a list and assign them to lunch groups. You can randomize the groups every lunch, so that your employees can always meet new people. You can select a preference for small, medium, or large groups.  Groups are always 3 - 5 people (unless you only have 1 - 2 people in your list, of course).  You can even delete names from the list!
